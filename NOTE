Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs)


We employed the ECCsplorer tool to identify extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) in four lepidopteran species—Bombyx mori, Danaus plexippus, Inachis io, and Lymantria dispar—with three biological replicates per species.
The average sequencing output is approximately 1 Gb, while average mapping rate range from 82 % to 94 % and the coverage varies from 0.7x to 4.7x.
